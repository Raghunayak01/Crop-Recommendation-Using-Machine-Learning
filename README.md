# Crop-Recommendation-Using-Machine-Learning
Crop Recommendation is a critical task for farmers and decision-makers in the 
agricultural sector. The ability to accurately forecast suitable crops for cultivation based 
on environmental and soil parameters can significantly impact agricultural productivity 
and profitability. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a crop 
prediction model that leverages machine learning techniques to provide farmers with 
informed recommendations. 
The primary objective of this project is to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable 
crops for cultivation by analyzing predicted rainfall, soil contents, and weather 
parameters. By considering these factors, the model can predict the crops that are likely 
to thrive under specific conditions. Moreover, the model provides additional insights 
such as the required fertilizers (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in kilograms per 
hectare and the necessary seed quantity in kilograms per acre for the recommended 
crop.
