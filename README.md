# Crop-Recommendation-Using-Machine-Learning
Crop Recommendation is a critical task for farmers and decision-makers in the 
agricultural sector. The ability to accurately forecast suitable crops for cultivation based 
on environmental and soil parameters can significantly impact agricultural productivity 
and profitability. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a crop 
prediction model that leverages machine learning techniques to provide farmers with 
informed recommendations. 
The primary objective of this project is to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable 
crops for cultivation by analyzing predicted rainfall, soil contents, and weather 
parameters. By considering these factors, the model can predict the crops that are likely 
to thrive under specific conditions. Moreover, the model provides additional insights 
such as the required fertilizers (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in kilograms per 
hectare and the necessary seed quantity in kilograms per acre for the recommended 
crop. 
# Features
Predicts the most suitable crop based on historical data and environmental parameters.
Provides information on required fertilizers, seeds, and market prices for the recommended crop.
Estimates the potential yield in quintal per acre for the recommended crop.
User-friendly web application for easy input of local parameters and accessing recommendations.
Integration of the model with real-time weather data for accurate predictions.
Dataset
The crop prediction model utilizes the "Crop Recommendation Dataset" obtained from Kaggle. This dataset contains information on various crops, including their nutrient requirements, weather conditions, and other relevant parameters. The dataset has been preprocessed and prepared for training the machine learning model.
